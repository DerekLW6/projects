Even a cursory review of Biden's record, in a vacuum or vs Bernie's, would reveal a relatively anti-choice, pro-austertity, right of center candidate. But the corporate media, by lies of omission &amp; commission, have obscured reality to meaninglessness,Women and seniors are the keys for Biden in these states.

In Wisconsin he has a 61-33 lead with women and a 81-13 lead with seniors.

In Kansas he has a 64-29 lead with women and a 81-12 lead with seniors:

2020-03-12 12:16:27,ThingyBlahBlah3,False,True,I've repeatedly said that Bernie's toxic fans don't even make my list of reasons why I went from #WarrenToBiden. Not a single Bernie supporter has asked me what those reasons are. They might take a hint from AOC on this one.,“If someone doesn’t do what you want, you don’t blame them.”

@AOC is the wisest voice right now among progressives, one who understands persuasion and doesn’t reflexively blame others when the movement comes up short. This is why she has a bright future.
