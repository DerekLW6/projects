2020-03-26 17:46:31,denngree,False,True,Bernie is a complete grifter.

He took a "brave" stand to argue for a vote outcome that was already certain before he left Vermont to travel to DC for the stunt.

It suckered in a few rubes who will slide Bernie a few more bucks for Bernie's 4th house fund.,Here is the order of events:

Republicans introduce Sasse amendment

Bernie makes speech

Every Republican votes for amendment, every Democrat votes against it, it falls well short of the 60 votes needed to pass.

Bernie praised as savior of the human race.

You’re alone on an island that this bill should be voted down bc migrant communities aren’t liable to get $1200. Governors can pick up on that since this racist admin won’t.,What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals, working people, and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare.

Without the Wall St giveaway, GOP refuses to fund hospitals &amp; unemployment. It’s inhumane.
