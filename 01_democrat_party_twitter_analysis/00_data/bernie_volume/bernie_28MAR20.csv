2020-03-28 19:14:08,Djsoundwave0,False,True,truths!!,The media HATES Bernie.

Why?

AT&amp;T owns CNN.

Comcast owns MSNBC.

Disney owns ABC.

Bernie wants to break up those parent companies. They're listed on his site.

The correlation couldn't be more obvious or transparent.

More people should write about that conflict of interest.

If there is a debate, can Biden beat miserable, meathead POTUS?,@KiniKa1mi I dont believe the DNC had anything to do with it. Bernie lost fair and square. His young peeps didnt come out. Also he has a bunch of toxic followers and Bernie has not told them to knock it off strongly enough. Bernie's base has shrunk since 2016.
