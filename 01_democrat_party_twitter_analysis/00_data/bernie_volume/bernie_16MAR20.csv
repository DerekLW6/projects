Then factor in the exit polls being different from the computer count by more than twice the margin of error.,@EclecticRadical @MimiTexasAngel @senatemajldr Bernie said that he was pursuing the votes of young voters, Latinos and rural whites.

Why didn't young voters and rural whites show up at the polls and save him on Super Tuesday?

We will not be scapegoats for his failed political strategy to ignore Black voters over 30.
