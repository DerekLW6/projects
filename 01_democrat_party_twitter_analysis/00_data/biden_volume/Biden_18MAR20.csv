2020-03-18 22:33:33,TheRevengerists,False,True,If Bernie doesn't get the nom, there's no doubt he'll support Biden. People who voted for Bernie in the primaries will vote overwhelmingly for Biden (like they did for Clinton in 2016), and the Bernie Supporters who weren't welcome in the Primaries will revert to being non-voters,.@BernieSanders is a good man who has mobilized young people and forever changed the Democratic party for the better, but he's not going to be our nominee. 

We're living in a dangerous time.
