2020-03-24 00:23:26,BTudbubble,False,True,Biden is semi-coherent in this clip and seems exhausted. I suspect he and his staff have decided to simply ride on the delegate lead and supers, and hide him from public view to keep people from catching on.,After 6 days, this is THE BEST take they could get out of @JoeBiden.

His family knows.
His staff knows.
The press knows.
The DNC knows.

Will no one speak up and tell the truth? At long last, have they no sense of decency?
