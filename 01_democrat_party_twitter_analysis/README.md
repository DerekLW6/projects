The purpose of this project was to see if there was a way to do any predictive modeling on Democratic 
Party Candidates and their Twitter valence/volume. 

We initially started with several candiates, but the field rapidly dropped to two, so most of the analysis was done
on Senator Sanders and former VP Biden. The tweets were streamed using an Amazon Web Services Instance with the Twitter API and the Tweepy Package.

The valence and volume were then modeled against primary performance. Although the model did not correspond to any 
meaningful trends (partly because we only had a month worth of data), it did result in some exciting visualizations 
(created in Tableau).
