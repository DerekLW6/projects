A technical analysis of hundreds of attacks from WW1 and WW2 to determine which factors were vital in making Commanders successful. 
Ultimately the best model was the Logistic Regression optimized on the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). I chose this because 
BIC has a penalty for adding too many features. Doing this made reduced the number of features Commanders would have to consider 
in preparation.

Surprisingly, many of the critical factors were intangible things like Morale and Leadership.
